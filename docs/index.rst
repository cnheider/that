Welcome to that's documentation!

    >>> import that
    The Anti-Zen of Python, by Daniel Greenfeld

    Ugly is better than beautiful.
    Implicit is better than explicit.
    Complicated is better than complex.
    Complex is better than simple.
    Nested is better than flat.
    Dense is better than sparse.
    Line code counts.
    Special cases are special enough to break the rules.
    Although purity beats practicality.
    Errors should always pass silently.
    Spelchek iz fur loosers.
    In the face of ambiguiy, one guess is as good as another.
    There should be many ways to do it.
    Because only a tiny minority of us are Dutch.
    Get things running, then fix them later. 
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's enterprisey.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it won't take enough time to do.
    Namespaces are too hard, just use "from module import *"!

Installation
=============

Installing from PyPI::

    pip install that

Or if you want to try and play with the awesome source code::

    git clone git@github.com:pydanny/that.git

Usage
======

From the Python shell::

    import that

Enjoy the wisdom!

Contributing
============

Clearly, the code that generates `THAT` is too straightforward. If you can make it better, then do so. Just don't do anything like add tests or document the code.
