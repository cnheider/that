Inspiration

These are the people who have made this project possible (in order of appearance):

Chris Shenton

For re-introducing me to Python in the summer of 2005.

Zed Shaw
=========

For helping me to remember never to take myself or this community that seriously.

Jacob Kaplan-Moss
==================

For calling me up on beach vacation in the August of 2010 and telling me to fix my code.

Audrey Roy
==========

For showing me daily how smart people do it.

Raymond Hettinger
==================

For demonstrating to me that after 5 years of doing Python professionally I barely qualify for the basic class.
