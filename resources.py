a = """The Anti-Zen of Python, by Daniel Greenfeld

Ugly is better than beautiful.
Implicit is better than explicit.
Complicated is better than complex.
Complex is better than simple.
Nested is better than flat.
Dense is better than sparse.
Line code counts.
Special cases are special enough to break the rules.
Although purity beats practicality.
Errors should always pass silently.
Spelchek iz fur loosers.
In the face of ambiguity, one guess is as good as another.
There should be many ways to do it.
Because only a tiny minority of us are Dutch.
Get things running, then fix them later.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's enterprisey.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it won't take enough time to do.
Namespaces are too hard, just use "from module import *"!"""
